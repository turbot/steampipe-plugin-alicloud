# Table: alicloud_vpc_route_table

A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

## Examples

### Basic info
This query is used to gain insights into the configuration of your Alicloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) by examining the details of its routing tables. It can be particularly useful in managing network traffic and ensuring optimal routing strategies within your VPC environment.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  route_table_id,
  description,
  route_table_type,
  router_id,
  region
from
  alicloud_vpc_route_table;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  route_table_id,
  description,
  route_table_type,
  router_id,
  region
from
  alicloud_vpc_route_table;
```

### Get VPC and VSwitch attachment info for each route table
Explore the relationships between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and virtual switch (VSwitch) by understanding their attachment details for each route table. This can be particularly useful in managing network routing and ensuring efficient data traffic within your cloud environment.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  route_table_id,
  vpc_id,
  jsonb_array_elements_text(vswitch_ids)
from
  alicloud_vpc_route_table;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  route_table_id,
  vpc_id,
  json_each.value
from
  alicloud_vpc_route_table,
  json_each(vswitch_ids);
```

### Routing details for each route table
Explore the intricate details of your network routing configurations. This query can help you understand how data is being directed across your network, which can be critical for troubleshooting connectivity issues or optimizing network performance.

```sql+postgres
select
  route_table_id,
  route_detail ->> 'Description' as description,
  route_detail ->> 'DestinationCidrBlock' as destination_CIDR_block,
  route_detail ->> 'InstanceId' as instance_id,
  route_detail ->> 'IpVersion' as ip_version,
  route_detail ->> 'NextHopOppsiteInstanceId' as next_hop_oppsite_instance_id,
  route_detail ->> 'NextHopOppsiteRegionId' as next_hop_oppsite_region_id,
  route_detail ->> 'NextHopOppsiteType' as next_hop_oppsite_type,
  route_detail ->> 'NextHopRegionId' as next_hop_region_id,
  route_detail ->> 'NextHopType' as next_hop_type,
  route_detail ->> 'RouteEntryId' as route_entry_id,
  route_detail ->> 'RouteEntryName' as route_entry_name,
  route_detail ->> 'RouteTableId' as route_table_id,
  route_detail ->> 'Status' as status
from
  alicloud_vpc_route_table,
  jsonb_array_elements(route_entries) as route_detail;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  route_table_id,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.Description') as description,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.DestinationCidrBlock') as destination_CIDR_block,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.InstanceId') as instance_id,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.IpVersion') as ip_version,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.NextHopOppsiteInstanceId') as next_hop_oppsite_instance_id,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.NextHopOppsiteRegionId') as next_hop_oppsite_region_id,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.NextHopOppsiteType') as next_hop_oppsite_type,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.NextHopRegionId') as next_hop_region_id,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.NextHopType') as next_hop_type,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.RouteEntryId') as route_entry_id,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.RouteEntryName') as route_entry_name,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.RouteTableId') as route_table_id,
  json_extract(route_detail.value, '$.Status') as status
from
  alicloud_vpc_route_table,
  json_each(route_entries) as route_detail;
```

### List route tables without application tag key
Determine the areas in which route tables lack an application tag key. This can be useful for identifying potential gaps in your tagging strategy, ensuring that all resources are correctly tagged for better management and organization.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  route_table_id
from
  alicloud_vpc_route_table
where
  not tags :: JSONB ? 'application';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  route_table_id
from
  alicloud_vpc_route_table
where
  json_extract(tags, '$.application') is null;
```
