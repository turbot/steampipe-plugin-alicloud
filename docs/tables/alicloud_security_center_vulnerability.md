# Table: alicloud_security_center_vulnerability - Query Alibaba Cloud Security Center Vulnerabilities using SQL

Alibaba Cloud Security Center continuously monitors your ECS instances and other assets for security vulnerabilities, including missing OS patches, application vulnerabilities, and system vulnerabilities. This table provides access to vulnerability information to help you maintain security compliance.

## Table Usage Guide

The `alicloud_security_center_vulnerability` table provides insights into vulnerabilities detected by Security Center within Alibaba Cloud. As a security engineer, explore vulnerability-specific details through this table, including vulnerability names, severity levels, affected instances, fix status, and patch information. Utilize it to identify instances with unfixed vulnerabilities, track patch compliance, and ensure all OS patches are applied.

## Examples

### List all unfixed vulnerabilities

Find all vulnerabilities that have not been fixed yet, which indicates missing patches or security issues.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  alias_name,
  instance_id,
  instance_name,
  type,
  level,
  status,
  can_fix,
  necessity,
  os_name,
  os_version,
  first_ts,
  region
from
  alicloud_security_center_vulnerability
where
  status = 0  -- 0 = unfixed
order by
  level,
  first_ts desc;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  alias_name,
  instance_id,
  instance_name,
  type,
  level,
  status,
  can_fix,
  necessity,
  os_name,
  os_version,
  first_ts,
  region
from
  alicloud_security_center_vulnerability
where
  status = 0  -- 0 = unfixed
order by
  level,
  first_ts desc;
```

### Count vulnerabilities by instance

Identify which ECS instances have the most unfixed vulnerabilities.

```sql+postgres
select
  instance_id,
  instance_name,
  os_name,
  os_version,
  count(*) as unfixed_vulnerability_count,
  count(*) filter (where level = 'high') as high_severity_count,
  count(*) filter (where level = 'medium') as medium_severity_count,
  count(*) filter (where level = 'low') as low_severity_count
from
  alicloud_security_center_vulnerability
where
  status = 0
  and instance_id is not null
group by
  instance_id,
  instance_name,
  os_name,
  os_version
order by
  unfixed_vulnerability_count desc;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  instance_id,
  instance_name,
  os_name,
  os_version,
  count(*) as unfixed_vulnerability_count,
  sum(case when level = 'high' then 1 else 0 end) as high_severity_count,
  sum(case when level = 'medium' then 1 else 0 end) as medium_severity_count,
  sum(case when level = 'low' then 1 else 0 end) as low_severity_count
from
  alicloud_security_center_vulnerability
where
  status = 0
  and instance_id is not null
group by
  instance_id,
  instance_name,
  os_name,
  os_version
order by
  unfixed_vulnerability_count desc;
```

### List high severity vulnerabilities

Find all high severity vulnerabilities that need immediate attention.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  alias_name,
  instance_id,
  instance_name,
  level,
  type,
  necessity,
  can_fix,
  need_reboot,
  first_ts,
  region
from
  alicloud_security_center_vulnerability
where
  status = 0
  and level = 'high'
order by
  first_ts desc;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  alias_name,
  instance_id,
  instance_name,
  level,
  type,
  necessity,
  can_fix,
  need_reboot,
  first_ts,
  region
from
  alicloud_security_center_vulnerability
where
  status = 0
  and level = 'high'
order by
  first_ts desc;
```

### List vulnerabilities by type

Group vulnerabilities by type to understand the distribution of different vulnerability categories.

```sql+postgres
select
  type,
  level,
  count(*) as count,
  count(*) filter (where status = 0) as unfixed_count,
  count(*) filter (where status = 1) as fixed_count
from
  alicloud_security_center_vulnerability
group by
  type,
  level
order by
  type,
  level;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  type,
  level,
  count(*) as count,
  sum(case when status = 0 then 1 else 0 end) as unfixed_count,
  sum(case when status = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as fixed_count
from
  alicloud_security_center_vulnerability
group by
  type,
  level
order by
  type,
  level;
```
