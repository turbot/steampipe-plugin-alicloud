# Table: alicloud_rds_instance_metric_cpu_utilization_daily - Query Alibaba Cloud RDS Instance Metrics using SQL

Alibaba Cloud Relational Database Service (RDS) is a stable and reliable online database service that supports MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL engines. It provides a complete set of solutions to handle disaster recovery, backup, restoration, monitoring, and migration, allowing users to focus on business innovation. RDS Instance Metrics provide detailed performance and health insights for instances within the RDS service.

## Table Usage Guide

The `alicloud_rds_instance_metric_cpu_utilization_daily` table provides insights into the daily CPU utilization of RDS instances within Alibaba Cloud. As a database administrator or DevOps engineer, you can explore instance-specific details through this table, including CPU usage patterns, peak usage times, and potential performance bottlenecks. Utilize it to monitor and optimize resource usage, ensuring the efficient operation of your databases.

## Examples

### Basic info
Explore CPU usage patterns over time for your Alicloud RDS instances. This can help you understand the load on your databases, enabling you to optimize performance and manage resources effectively.

```sql+postgres
select
  db_instance_id,
  timestamp,
  minimum,
  maximum,
  average
from
  alicloud_rds_instance_metric_cpu_utilization_daily
order by
  db_instance_id,
  timestamp;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  db_instance_id,
  timestamp,
  minimum,
  maximum,
  average
from
  alicloud_rds_instance_metric_cpu_utilization_daily
order by
  db_instance_id,
  timestamp;
```

### CPU over 80% average
Identify instances where the average CPU utilization exceeds 80% for daily metrics. This can be particularly useful for spotting potential performance issues in your database instances.

```sql+postgres
select
  db_instance_id,
  timestamp,
  round(minimum::numeric,2) as min_cpu,
  round(maximum::numeric,2) as max_cpu,
  round(average::numeric,2) as avg_cpu
from
  alicloud_rds_instance_metric_cpu_utilization_daily
where
  average > 80
order by
  db_instance_id,
  timestamp;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  db_instance_id,
  timestamp,
  round(minimum,2) as min_cpu,
  round(maximum,2) as max_cpu,
  round(average,2) as avg_cpu
from
  alicloud_rds_instance_metric_cpu_utilization_daily
where
  average > 80
order by
  db_instance_id,
  timestamp;
```
