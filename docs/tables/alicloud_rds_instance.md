  alicloud_rds_instance;
```

### DB instance count in each region

```sql
select
  region_id as region,
  db_instance_class,
  count(*)
from
  alicloud_rds_instance
group by
  region_id,
  db_instance_class;
```

### List DB instances whose engine is MySQL

```sql
select
  db_instance_id,
  vpc_id,
  creation_time,
  engine
from
  alicloud_rds_instance
where
  engine = 'MySQL';
```

### List DB instances that are currently running

```sql
select
  db_instance_id,
  vpc_id,
  creation_time,
  engine
from
  alicloud_rds_instance
where
  db_instance_status = 'Running';
```

### List DB instances that allow 0.0.0.0/0

select
  db_instance_id,
  security_ips
from
  alicloud_rds_instance
where
  security_ips :: jsonb ? '0.0.0.0/0'
```

  s ->> 'NetworkType' as network_type,
  s ->> 'RegionId' as security_group_region_id,
  s ->> 'SecurityGroupId' as security_group_id
from
  alicloud_rds_instance as i,
  jsonb_array_elements(security_group_configuration) as s;
